so the steps in this book show the commands in these directories without absolute
path names. Steps that use commands in other, less common, directories show
the absolute path in the example.</para>

installation without the Binary Compatibility Package installed and without <filename>/usr/ucb</filename> in the path.</para><caution><para>If <filename>/usr/ucb</filename> is included in a search path,
it should always be at the end of the search path. Commands like <command>ps</command> or <command>df</command> are duplicated in <filename>/usr/ucb</filename> with different
formats and different options from the SunOS  Solaris commands.</para>
