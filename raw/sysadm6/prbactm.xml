<title>Roles, Rights Profiles, and Privileges</title>
<partintro><para>This section covers role-based access control (RBAC) and process rights
management. RBAC components include roles, rights profiles, and authorizations.
Process rights management is implemented through privileges. Privileges work
with RBAC to provide a more secure administration alternative than administration
of a system by a superuser.</para>
